# Amazon-Prime-TV-Shows-and-Movies-EDA
The goal of this project was to perform an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Amazon Prime’s TV Shows and Movies dataset to uncover insights that can support data-driven business decisions. The focus was on understanding content trends, user preferences, content quality indicators, and identifying areas for strategic improvement.

# Dataset Overview
The analysis was performed on a merged dataset that combined two sources: 'titles.csv' (content metadata) and credits.csv (cast and crew information). Key fields included title type, genres, IMDb scores, runtime, release year, cast, and certification.

# Key Analyses and Visualizations
1. Content Distribution: Movies dominate the platform, but TV Shows exhibit higher median IMDb scores.

2. IMDb Score Analysis: Most content falls between 5 and 7 IMDb rating; high-rated content (>8.5) is limited.

3. Genre Popularity: Drama, Comedy, and Action are the most common and watched genres.

4. Runtime Insights: Runtime does not strongly correlate with ratings, suggesting quality matters more than length.

5. Release Year Trends: A surge in content production post-2015, with 2020 being a peak year.

6. Actor/Director Frequency: Identified top contributors across Amazon Prime content.

# Business Insights
TV Shows offer better average viewer satisfaction, suggesting investment in serial content is strategic.
Genre trends can inform personalized recommendations and content acquisition.
Weak correlation between runtime and score helps optimize content length.
An imbalance in movie quality (high variance in scores) signals a need for better filtering or review.

# Recommendations
Increase focus on high-quality TV shows.
Prioritize Drama, Comedy, and Action for content development.
Use IMDb score trends to filter low-performing content.
Monitor runtime-to-score patterns to manage production resources better.
Improve movie quality control to avoid score inconsistencies.

# Problem Statement
This dataset was created to analyze all shows available on Amazon Prime Video, allowing us to extract valuable insights such as:

Content Diversity: What genres and categories dominate the platform?

Regional Availability: How does content distribution vary across different regions?

Trends Over Time: How has Amazon Prime’s content library evolved?

IMDb Ratings & Popularity: What are the highest-rated or most popular shows on the platform?

By analyzing this dataset, businesses, content creators, and data analysts can uncover key trends that influence subscription growth, user engagement, and content investment strategies in the streaming industry.

# Business Objective
To analyze Amazon Prime’s TV Shows and Movies dataset in order to uncover insights on content trends, audience preferences, and quality indicators such as IMDb scores, runtime, and release patterns. The goal is to help the platform enhance user engagement, optimize content acquisition and production strategies, and identify underperforming areas to reduce churn and boost viewer satisfaction.
